## Shiny Special Education Progress Monitoring Tool

**ShinyApp**: https://seul-b.shinyapps.io/sped-progress-monitor-tool/

  This ShinyApp is intended to support special education professionals with interactive data collection and graphing functions. Special education professionals will be able to input details and corresponding data for each step for a student to complete through multiple systematic instructional strategies, including task analysis, time delay, least-to-most and most-to-least prompt hierarchies, and simultaneous prompting, as well as their customized instruction or assessment data. They can also save the collected data to their local devices and retrieve it as needed. More details can be found at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l6PnyDNlEFu797-Pu4r7wb6dKg-t9pwwRaO-L7_1Cv0/edit

**PLEASE READ BEFORE USE**:

1. The instructional strategy from the data imported and that you input on the shiny app should be the same.
2. Please DO NOT change the format of the template (i.e., the default rows and columns) and name new dates as ‘Date.#’.
3. Clicking ‘Graph’ without the data shown on the main panel will generate errors and close your app.
4. Your data will not be automatically saved. Make sure to download your data if you want to reload your collected data later.
